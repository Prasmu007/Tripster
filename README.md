# Tripster
Visit the deployed website: <a>https://tripster-kappa.vercel.app</a>
## Objectives
1. To reduce the hassle in trip planning, we plan on redesigning TripAdvisor in a way where it does most
of the work for the user.
2. We take simple user inputs relating to the number of people, budget as well as interests; and provide
relevant places to match their expectations.
3. Additionally, we can also add a section that displays reels/posts from Instagram related to the area the
user plans to visit, including food, tourist spots, etc.

## The flaws in the site:
• There exists a system to monitor and display all the locations relevant to travel, including accommodation, places to
visit etc, however:
• No recommendations based on budget.
• The individual has to research all options for each activity they want or need to do.

## Our proposed improvements:
On searching by location, the users are asked for a specific set of details, namely:
• Overall budget
• Number of people traveling (to filter living accommodations)
• The time period of the trip

### Interests choosing page, similar to the following:
Given the interests, the overall budget would be divided into the following 3 categories:
• Places to visit
• Living
• Food

### Once decided, all options within the price ranges decided above will be shown.

## STEPS TO REPLICATE:

1. Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/Prasmu007/Tripster.git```
2. ``` cd Frontend ```
3. ``` npm install ```
4. ``` npm start ```
